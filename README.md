# Winsock-PCAP- BsidesAugusta 2016

During engagements the need for pure native solutions will in some cases outweigh a risky counterpart. Winsock-PCAP attempts to show a POC of how an older method yet safe native PCAP can take place using the Winsock2 library. This uses a reflective DLL injection to deploy and named pipes using a PowerShell POC communicator.
